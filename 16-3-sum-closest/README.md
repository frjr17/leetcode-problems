# Problem 16. 3Sum closest

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## My Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var threeSumClosest = function (nums, target) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let closestSum = Infinity;
  let minDiff = Infinity;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
    let left = i + 1;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
      const sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
      const diff = Math.abs(sum - target);

      if (diff < minDiff) {
        minDiff = diff;
        closestSum = sum;
      }

      if (sum < target) {
        left++;
      } else {
        right--;
      }
    }
  }

  return closestSum;
};
```

Is almost great (87.63% runtime, but 33.08% memory)!!

## Things to learn:

- Two-pointer approach
- More Practice Times
