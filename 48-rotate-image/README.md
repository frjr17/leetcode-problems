# Problem 48. Rotate Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

## My Solution

```js
//  My Solution
/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
 */
var rotate = function (matrix) {
  const n = matrix.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
      [matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]] = [matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]];
    }
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    matrix[i].reverse();
  }
};
```

It runs great (98.73% runtime, 71.63% memory)
